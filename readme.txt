So in this projects, the code sucks (on purpose!)
To really accurately replicate the registers and moving data between registers, I have intentionally avoided passing data as arguments, preferring to move data between registers.
The code is not something I would normally write, and I greatly loathe how it looks, but the purpose of this project is for me to get a good understanding of data movement and logic in a CPU

I am also aware that the code doesn't follow the PEP style guide. There is no reason for this :3

The "steps" stuff is also not a part of LMC or CPUs, but I have these in here to make the simulation work

This project comes with a program made already (called trinum.txt) which uses all the various mnemonics, this should act as a cool way to see all the features of the LMC, but it is a tad complex and long so there are likely better ways to see all the features.
